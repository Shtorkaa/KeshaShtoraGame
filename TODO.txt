- Turn wall and eraser hitboxes into world border type ones
- Finish the same thing i did with pickup signals system on bricks and the ball to be able to create variations
- Look up if there a way to replace Node is ClassName type checks with a switch case construction
? Problem of having both Stage and Game objects can be solved by spawning all nodes that Stage holds using a script of Game node, which is kinda annoying at the current game state but would be good to inevitably implement imo
? Silly test note
