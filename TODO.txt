- Turn wall and eraser hitboxes into world border type ones
? Problem of having both Stage and Game objects can be solved by spawning all nodes that Stage holds using a script of Game node, which is kinda annoying at the current game state but would be good to inevitably implement imo
! Fix Bricks forgetting they have gravity (check brick.gd notes for more info)
! Fix Area3D (ERASER) not detecting StaticBody3D (BALL) moving into it
- Load all balls into one node (dont forget to update ApplyEffect)
? Maybe load Balls, Pickups and Bricks into Level; But then whats the point of Level node itslf

? Set modifier on ModifiableFloat should return self to allow for one liner inits + setters
  (aka var a = ModifiableFloat.new().set_modifier().set_modifier() )
- Improve / remove debug option on ModifiableFloat
  I wote for remove
- Add args to effect calls (duration, value)
  Ball.apply('speed', 13, 10)

BUGS
- Bug with multiple effects ball origin model shown / hidden
  Same solution as with speed class ig
- Bug with ball speed falling down for some reason (again)
- Bug effect randomly extends its own duration
- Bug with effect visuals (ticking) when set to lower than minimum duration

! Ball bounces off of objects using 3 axes, if it bounces by any percent on y it will slow/stop
