? Problem of having both Stage and Game objects can be solved by spawning all nodes that Stage holds using a script of Game node, which is kinda annoying at the current game state but would be good to inevitably implement imo
! Fix Area3D (ERASER) not detecting StaticBody3D (BALL) moving into it
- Load all balls into one node (dont forget to update ApplyEffect)
