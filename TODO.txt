- Turn wall and eraser hitboxes into world border type ones
? Problem of having both Stage and Game objects can be solved by spawning all nodes that Stage holds using a script of Game node, which is kinda annoying at the current game state but would be good to inevitably implement imo
! Fix Area3D (ERASER) not detecting StaticBody3D (BALL) moving into it
- Load all balls into one node (dont forget to update ApplyEffect)

- Make ModifiableFloat also fit for integers
? Could optimize ModifiableFloat's fixed value execution (not sure what to do with modifications when half way thour modifiers it finds a fixed value, either count to finish or reset to some defaullt values imo)

epple? :3
